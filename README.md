# Trucking Logistics Calculator – Pro Pricing

## Overview  
The **Trucking Logistics Calculator** is a JavaScript-based tool designed to optimize **cost estimations and route planning** for **Circle M Landscape**. By dynamically computing trucking costs based on **load capacity, distance, truck type, and material selection**, this calculator enhances pricing accuracy and streamlines logistics decision-making.

## Why This Project?  
This project was built as I explored **optimizing logistics through JavaScript**. Throughout development, I experimented with **various approaches, refining the logic and structure over time**. While the commit history reflects an **iterative learning process**, the final product represents a **working solution that improves cost accuracy and efficiency**.

## Key Features  
- **Dynamic Cost Calculation** – Calculates trucking costs based on **mileage, load weight, material type, and truck selection**.  
- **Automated Truck Assignment** – Selects the best available truck based on **capacity and load constraints**.  
- **Interactive Cost Breakdown** – Displays **per-load pricing, travel time, and overall cost structure** in a user-friendly format.  
- **Real-Time Adjustments** – Instantly updates cost estimates based on **user input modifications**.  
- **Data Validation & Error Handling** – Prevents miscalculations by ensuring **valid input values**.  
- **Scalability & Future Enhancements** – Designed to **integrate additional features**, such as **fuel cost tracking, delivery scheduling, and automated invoicing**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **JavaScript** – Core logic for cost calculations and truck assignments.  
- **HTML & CSS** – Provides a clean and intuitive UI for user input.  
- **Google Maps API** – Retrieves real-time distance data for accurate cost calculations.  
- **Netlify** – Handles deployment and hosting for easy access.
